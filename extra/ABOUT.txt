In EXTRA directory you can find improved .htaccess file with additional options. Use it to fix some security and performance issues. What do they change?

# Store session ID only in cookies
php_value session.use_only_cookies 1

# Do not attach session ID to URLs
php_value session.use_trans_sid 0

# Disable register_globals - feature removed in PHP6
php_value register_globals 0

# Disable magic_quotes - feature removed in PHP6
php_value magic_quotes_gpc 0

If your server do not support php_value command, it may show INTERNAL SERVER ERROR (500). To disable risky PHP options which are enabled by default, visit your hosting's documentation.

More additional resources are coming soon into EXTRA folder :)
